# Simulation of a quantum experiment with entangled particles to check Bell's theorem

This repository contains code that simulates Bell's test for two physical cases: electron spins and photon polarization.

## Bell's Test

Bell's test is an experiment in quantum mechanics that aims to investigate the violation of local realism, a principle in classical physics. It involves measuring the correlation between entangled particles that are separated by a large distance.

The experiment explores the phenomenon of quantum entanglement, where particles become intrinsically linked so that the state of one particle is instantaneously connected to the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. Bell's test helps verify the predictions of quantum mechanics and reveals the inconsistencies between classical physics and quantum mechanics.

By simulating Bell's test for electron spins and photon polarization, this repository provides insights into the measurement statistics and outcomes in these entangled systems. It allows for the exploration and validation of Bell's theorem, showcasing the unique features of quantum entanglement.

## Simulation

This repository provides two implementations of the simulation:

- **Electron-Spin**: The `electron-spin` directory contains code that simulates a quantum experiment involving entangled electron spins to investigate and validate Bell's theorem. It explores the measurement statistics of electron spin outcomes based on different measurement rules.

- **Photon-Polarization**: The `photon-polarization` directory contains code that simulates a quantum experiment involving entangled photons to test Bell's theorem. It focuses on the measurement statistics of photon polarization outcomes and the probability of coincidence or non-coincidence based on different measurement angles.
